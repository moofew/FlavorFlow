### College Cookbook


##### College Cookbook

_This cookbook was put together for my daughter Cali as she begins her
sophomore year of college_.

College students tend to be BUSY and BROKE which can make cooking
difficult. When they are use to having all their meals prepared by
mom or the dorm cafeteria this transition to having to cook all their
meals, every day can be a hard transition.

Being the mother of 3 college students (one recently graduated –
yeah) I know a little bit about college cooking. I have received
numerous calls over the years asking questions on how to cook
something etc. The funny thing is though – I have no memory of
cooking in college myself. I am sure I did but I have no idea what I
cooked. I did date a lot so maybe I just let my dates feed me!

It is important for college students to know that there is a world
beyond Mac and Cheese and Top Ramen!! Although, they make a
great standby and should be part of every college kid’s pantry!! Add a
little protein like some strips of chicken, a can of tuna fish or some
canned chili to it to make it a little healthier.

I consider a George Foreman grill to be an essential college cooking
appliance. You can make a quesadilla, grilled cheese sandwich, burger
or chicken breast in minutes. Every college apartment should have
one. They are fairly inexpensive and essential!

Another necessary appliance is a microwave. When your only option is
eating something that comes out of a can, a microwave can quickly
heat up a can of soup, chili or even spaghetti-o’s! It doesn’t get much
easier than a microwave, can opener and a bowl!! But this option can
get old real fast.

The other essential kitchen appliance is a crockpot. Using some of
your extra time on the weekend to cook up some meat/protein
(chicken, pot roast, pork carnitas) is a great idea. It can feed you for
the rest of the week. You can eat it with potatoes, pasta or rice. Use
it to make a taco, quesadilla or burrito. All you need to make a
burrito/taco is some meat, a tortilla and maybe some beans and
cheese!

In addition to many of our easier family favorites this cookbook
contains a few No Recipe Cooking ideas too!


##### No Recipe Cooking

##### Easy Chicken Ideas

**Oven Barbequed Chicken**
Can be made on a grill or in the oven. Just place your chicken pieces
in a pan, cover with BBQ sauce and bake at 350 degrees for 45
minutes or until meat is cooked all the way through. Cooking time will
vary depending on the type and size of chicken you used (thighs, legs,
breast with bone or boneless) Baste the chicken again with the sauce
part way through the cooking process.

**Seasoned Chicken**
Same as above but instead of BBQ sauce use salt and pepper and
some favorite seasonings on the chicken – garlic seasoning, Italian
seasoning etc.

**Teriyaki Chicken**
Another quick and easy version. Just buy some bottled teriyaki sauce
and marinade the chicken over night in a ziploc baggie with the sauce.
Grill or bake chicken at 350 degrees for 45 min. Throw away the
marinade once you remove the chicken. You can use it to baste the
chicken as it cooks. Do not ever use leftover marinade as a sauce.
Once raw chicken has been in it there is bacteria and it is unsafe.
Throw it away.

**Chicken Stir Fry**
Use a large frying pan or wok. Cut chicken into bite size pieces. Cook
chicken over a medium flame in a frying pan with a little butter/oil,
onions and spices. After chicken is browned add some chicken broth.
Cook about 5 minutes more until chicken is cooked through and then
add the vegetables. (fresh or frozen) The vegetables will cook quickly

- cook just until tender – not mush! Probably about another 5
minutes.


**Chicken Fajitas**
Slice onions, peppers (red and green) and chopped garlic. Sauté
onions, and garlic in a little oil. Add a sprinkle of chili powder and
cumin. Cut uncooked chicken breasts into strips. (Be sure to wash
knives and cooking boards very well after cutting the raw chicken).
Add peppers. And chicken to the onions, garlic and spices and sauté
until the chicken is cooked (10-15 min.) Serve with flour tortillas,
salsa, sour cream, guacamole, olives or anything else you might have
in the fridge!


##### Easy Egg Ideas

One of the quickest and easiest meals to prepare and one that is full of
protein and not expensive is eggs. Breakfast for dinner is a great
college option, inexpensive and quick to prepare.

**Hard-Boiled Egg**

If you can boil water you can boil an egg. Boil a pot of water with the
eggs in it for about 10 min. Then immediately place eggs into cold
water to stop the cooking process. You can eat then just the way they
are (peel them of course) or slice them to put them on a salad.

**Scrambled Eggs**

Scrambled eggs are good anytime of day. Just beat the eggs until the
white and yolk are combined. You can add a little salt and pepper
or seasoning if you like. Melt a teaspoon of butter into a small frying
pan and add your eggs. Continue to stir the eggs until they are set up
and cooked to the consistency you like them (dry or shiny). Add in
some cheese or left over meat (ham, bacon etc.) before eggs are
completely cooked.

**Fried Eggs**

To fry an egg, put about a teaspoon of butter in small frying pan.
Crack your egg into pan, add seasoning (salt and pepper) and cook on
low-medium heat. You can test the firmness of your egg by gently
shaking the pan. Do not allow it to cook too long or it can become
rubbery. Before egg is completely cooked the way you like gently flip
it over in the pan using a spatula allow the other side to cook for a
minute or so.

**Bird in a Nest Eggs**

Similar to a fried egg but with a piece of bread. Melt butter in a small
frying pan. Cut a hole in a piece of bread – can just use a knife or a
round cookie cutter or the rim of a glass. Place your bread with the
hole into the pan then crack an egg into the hole. Salt and pepper and
cooked according to the fried egg directions above


**Egg Sandwich**

Fry your egg or scramble as described above. Serve between two
pieces of bread, a bagel, or English muffin. Add a slice of cheese if
you’d like!

**Omelets**

Don’t let the idea of cooking an omelet intimidate you – It’s just a little
fancier version of scrambled eggs. You don’t need an omelet pan – you
can just use a regular small frying pan. Beat eggs (2-3) in a bowl and
add salt and pepper. Cut or grate cheese and additional fillings before
you start cooking the eggs. You can use left over ham, bacon, green
onion, peppers, mushrooms, tomatoes etc. Clean out the refrigerator!

Melt butter over a low heat in a frying pan, then add eggs. When eggs
start to cook, using a spatula to push the cooked parts away from the
side and let uncooked egg flow around to the bottom of the pan.
Continue doing this until the majority of the egg is "set" (cooked). Add
cheese and extras, then flip half of the egg over the top of the filling.
Let cook another few minutes, then flip and cook a few more minutes
on the other side. The omelet will be done when it is light brown and
egg cooked through.


##### Easy Ground Beef/Hamburger Ideas

The possibilities for a pound of ground beef/ hamburger are endless!
The more expensive the ground beef the less fat it will have. If you
choose to buy hamburger that has a higher percentage of fat just
know that the fat will cook down and you will end up with less meat
than in a lower fat percentage one. Brown your ground beef in a
frying pan and add your desired seasonings.

Browned ground beef can be used in burritos, tacos, spaghetti sauce,
chili, sloppy joes, stroganoff or over a baked potato.

Ground Beef can also be used for:

**Hamburgers**

Use your George Foreman grill to make your hamburgers. Add
seasoning into your uncooked ground beef – dried or fresh onion,
garlic powder, onion powder etc. Mix until well combined. Divide
mixture into hamburger patties and broil for about 5-10 min. on each
side (depending on how well done you like your burger).

**Tacos**

Add packaged taco seasoning mix per the directions on the package to
your ground beef or season it yourself with chili powder, salt and
pepper and some cumin. Serve in corn or flour tortillas or make a taco
salad and serve over tortilla chips and lettuce. Add your favorite
toppings.

**Burritos**

Fill your flour tortilla with your cooked ground beef and some canned
beans – black or refried beans. Add cheese and other favorite
toppings and roll up! These can also be frozen and cooked in the
microwave later.

**Sloppy Joes**

Sloppy Joes are also quick and easy to make with ground beef. You
can buy packaged sloppy joe seasoning at the store – just add it to
your meat along with some tomato sauce (those directions should be
on the package.) Serve over a baked potato or on a hamburger bun.


**Spaghetti**

Spaghetti is another great way to use your browned beef. You can use
a jar of marinara/spaghetti sauce and just add your meat to make
your spaghetti a more substantial meal or make your own spaghetti
sauce using tomato sauce, onions, garlic and mushrooms if you like.
The longer a spaghetti sauce simmers the better the flavor is. Adding
a can of tomato paste will thicken the sauce more. Add a little
parmesan cheese on top for some extra flavor.

**Easy Stroganoff**

Brown your hamburger and onions, and drain fat. Add a can of cream
of mushroom or cream of onion soup and 1/2 can of water. Add salt
and pepper if needed. The soup already has salt in it so be careful not
to over salt. Continue cooking until it thickens – 5 - 1 0 minutes or so.


##### Recommended Spices and Seasoning

volume. Put the water in the mixing bowl and sprinkle in the yeast.
Let stand to dissolve for 5 minutes. Add the milk, butter, salt, sugar,
and flour to the yeast mixture and beat until smooth and blended (I
often use a hand rotary beater to get rid of the lumps). Cover the
bowl with plastic wrap and let stand overnight at room temperature.
Just before cooking the waffles, beat in the eggs, add the baking soda,
and stir until well-mixed. The batter will be very thin. Pour about 1/2
to ¾ cup batter into a very hot waffle iron. Bake the waffles until they
are golden and crisp. This batter will keep well for several days in the
refrigerator. Makes about 8 waffles

1 C fresh basil, chopped (or use a mixture of fresh basil and sage)
¼ tsp salt
¼-1/2 C grated Parmesan cheese, to taste.

Cook the noodles according to package directions until they are al
dente.(not too soft)

Five minutes before the pasta is done, melt the butter in a large heavy
skillet over medium heat. Add the oil, garlic and pine nuts and cook for
about 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. (if you don’t eat nuts the dish is
still delicious with them).

Before draining the pasta, use a ladle to scoop out about ¼ to ½ cup
of the cooking water. Add pasta to skillet with butter and garlic, the
reserved cooking liquid, the basil, salt and Parmesan cheese and toss
over low heat for 1-2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Serve it hot. (do

##### Herbed Pasta

ala Mark Bittman
Salt
1/3 C extra virgin olive oil or more as needed
2 Tbsp minced garlic
1 or 2 small dried red chilies or to taste, or hot red pepper flakes to
taste (optional)
1/2 C chopped nuts such as pine nuts, walnuts, almonds, hazelnuts,
pecans.
1/2 C fresh herbs – combination of basil, parsley, thyme, chives,
rosemary etc.
1 pound long, thin pasta, like linguine or spaghetti or any other pasta
1/2 C grated fresh Parmesan cheese

Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt it. Add pasta when it
comes to a boil.
Heat the oil. When hot, add the nuts and cook, stirring frequently,
until they start to toast and become fragrant, just a minute or two.


Turn down the heat to medium -low and stir in the chilies, garlic and a
large pinch of salt.

Let the garlic sizzle a bit, shaking the pan occasionally, just until it
turns golden, about 3 minutes. Toss in the herb mixture (total of 1/2 -
1 cup) The herb mixture may absorb all the oil so if it does add a little
more oil when you toss it with the pasta or add in some of the pasta
water.

Turn off the heat if the pasta isn’t ready.

Cook the pasta until it is tender but not mushy. When it is done, drain
it, reserving a bit of the cooking water. Reheat the herb/garlic mixture
briefly if necessary. Taste and adjust the seasoning, toss with Parmesan

##### cheese and serve – yum!
