Student Cook Book


Introduction

Food. It’s something we all think about every day, even multiple times a day. It’s a

necessity. It’s a delicacy. It’s energy and fuel. It’s a treat. It’s the center of celebrations, the

heart of family and friend gatherings.

It can also be a hassle for some people. Expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to

prepare.

```
But it doesn’t have to be that way.
Good food—healthy, delicious, tasty, nutritious, satisfying—can also be simple food.
```
And simple is key in college. Most college students are juggling very busy schedules including

classes, homework, jobs, friends, family, sports, clubs or other extra-curricular activities. Adding

cooking and eating into that mix can be stressful.

```
The purpose of this cookbook is to relieve the USU student’s stress in at least one area—
```
food. This cookbook is filled with recipes designed for busy college students who may not have

a lot of time to cook or a lot of money to buy food.

```
It also has some great resources beyond just recipes. Included is a list of cooking terms
```
and definitions, tips for grocery shopping, a helpful method for making your meals healthy and

balanced, and other tips and tricks to make preparing and eating meals the least of your

worries.

```
Enjoy!

## What Makes a Meal?........................................................................................................................


What Makes a Meal?

To keep it simple, a meal is made up of 3 different components or food groups as we

usually call them:

1. Protein
2. Grain
3. Produce (vegetables/fruits)

All of these different food groups have great health benefits on their own. Protein is a great

source of energy, is satiating, and helps to build and rebuild muscles. Grains are the main

source of fuel for our body and brain. Vegetables and fruits are full of fiber and important

vitamins and minerals. When each component is combined together in a meal, the nutrition

benefits increase even more.

An easy way to make sure that you are getting a protein, grain, and produce item in

each meal is to use the Plate Method. Mentally divide your plate into three parts when

planning or preparing a meal and then fill each part with one of the three meal components.

Using this method can help you achieve balance, variety, and nutrition with each meal.

And it’s so simple!


## Grocery Shopping Tips.....................................................................................................................


Tips for Making the Most of Grocery Shopping

Before you shop:

- Create and use a grocery list
- Schedule a set shopping day once a week (or how often you need to shop)
- Don’t shop hungry
- Look for ads in the mail or online to know what deals are available

At the store:

- Shop the perimeter of the store for staples like produce, grains, and protein
- Compare prices using the unit cost which is in the corner of the price tag
- Compare prices of name brands and store brand items—this can be a big money saver!
- Stock up on staples when they are on sale
- Get foods that need to be refrigerated or frozen last
- Be aware of marketing tactics trying to get you to buy more than what you actually need

After:

- Keep raw meats separated from other food (all raw meats should be stored at the
    bottom of your fridge or freezer)
- Store your foods properly as soon as you get home to avoid spoiling the food you just
    bought
- Prepare necessary fruits and vegetables to ensure they will be eaten before spoiling

Other Tips:

- Produce:
    o Buying produce in bulk is not always better because it can spoil faster. Only buy
       what you will eat.
    o Pre-cut and bagged options are a great convenience options
- Breads:
    o Read labels to find bread that has WHOLE grain flour as the first ingredient
    o Aim for bread with 3-6 g of fiber per serving
- Middle Aisles:
    o Choose health oils (olive, canola, nuts)
    o Nuts are a great protein option
    o Choose cereals, pastas, and rice with high fiber content
    o Choose fruit canned in water or juice rather than heavy syrup
- Frozen foods:
    o Frozen fruit can be easily added to breakfasts or smoothies


```
o Frozen vegetables can be cooking easily (microwaved)
o Some frozen dinners/meals are healthier than others so look for low fat, low
sodium, high protein meals
```
- Meats:
    o Buy in bulk and freeze for convenience
    o Leaner cuts are often cheaper and are healthier
    o Look for the words LOIN and ROUND
- Cheese:
    o White cheese tends to be lower in fat
    o Cottage cheese is a great source of protein
    o Use string cheese for portable snacks
    o Use unit pricing to find the best price
- Milk and Eggs:
    o All types of cow’s milk have the same nutrients, the only difference is fat and
       calories
    o Cow’s milk DOES NOT contain any added sugar and is a natural source of protein
    o Choose low-sugar options of yogurt
    o Eggs are an inexpensive source of protein

**Ramen**
_What is more college-friendly than ramen? Ramen is cheap and easy to make, but it’s not the
most nutrient rich food out there. Here are some recipes that use ramen but have some added
healthy ingredients._

Start with your basic ramen noodle package and add your favorite protein and vegetables.

Protein Ideas:

```
Egg, boiled egg
Beef, sautéed in strips
Chicken, sautéed in strips
Pork, sautéed in strips
Tofu
```
Vegetable Ideas:

Package of frozen Asian vegetables
Carrots
Zucchini

Broccoli

Corn

Peas, Snap Peas

Onions (any variety)

1. Cut up your protein and any fresh vegetables.
2. Heat 2 C of water to boiling. Add Ramen noodles and boil for 5 minutes. Add half of the
    flavoring packet to reduce sodium content.
3. While you’re waiting for the Ramen...
    Fresh vegetables: Stir-fry fresh veggies in pan (coated with cooking spray) over
    medium heat for 5 minutes. Add meat. Stir-fry until meat is well-cooked.
    Frozen vegetables: Stir-fry meat in pan (coated with cooking spray) over medium-
    high heat for 5 minutes. Add frozen vegetables and 1-2 TB of water, and stir-fry until
    veggies are softened.
4. Add veggies and meat to the Ramen, and enjoy!

_Recipe courtesy of Shayna Bedingfield_


**Quick Ramen Bowl**

1 package Ramen noodles
1 C fresh spinach
3 medium button mushrooms
2 whole green onions
1 large egg (optional)

1. In a small pot, bring 2 cups of water to a boil. While you are waiting for the water to boil,
wash and slice the veggies (spinach, mushrooms, green onions). Add the dry noodles to the
boiling water and cook for about 5 minutes. Add the seasoning packet (or half a packet if you
prefer less sodium) and stir until dissolved.
2. Turn the heat down to medium and stir in all of the fresh veggies. Allow them to sit in the hot
(not boiling) broth for 1-2 minutes or until slightly softened. Voila! You can go ahead and enjoy
your Ramen, or follow the next step if you’d like some protein.
3. Make a well in the center of the pot and crack the egg into it. Allow the egg to poach in the
broth until the whites are solid but the yolk is still runny. Alternatively, you can break the yolk
and stir the pot just slightly to yield egg ribbons like in egg drop soup. The water should not be
boiling at this point or else your egg will dissolve into such small pieces that it will give you a
cloudy broth.

**Garlic Parmesan Kale Pasta Meal Prep**
There are 3 parts to this recipe which makes it a little time consuming; however, this can save
you time because it will give you several meals instead of just one. Prepare each recipe
separately and then combine each component into a plastic or glass container that you can take
with you on the go.

For the Chicken:
1/4 cup olive oil
1/4 cup lemon juice
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 Tbsp. dried oregano
1/2 tsp salt
Freshly cracked pepper
1.5 lbs. boneless skinless chicken breasts (about 2) or 4-6 chicken thighs

1. Add olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper to a large zip top bag, or a large
shallow dish. Close the bag and massage to mix the ingredients, or stir the ingredients in the
dish until combined.
2. Filet each chicken breast into two thinner pieces. You should now have 4 pieces of chicken.
Place the pieces in the bag or dish, making sure the chicken pieces are completely covered in
marinade. Marinate the chicken for at least 30 minutes and up to 8 hours, turning occasionally
to maximize the chicken's contact with the marinade. The longer you marinate the chicken, the
more flavorful it will be.
3. When ready to cook, heat a large skillet over medium flame or on medium heat. Transfer the
chicken from the marinade to the hot skillet and cook on each side until well browned and
cooked through (about 5-7 minutes each side, depending on the size of the pieces). I cooked
two pieces at a time to avoid over-crowding the skillet, which can cause juices to pool and
prevents browning. Discard any excess marinade.
4. Transfer the cooked chicken from the skillet to a cutting board and let rest for five minutes
before slicing and storing.


For the Kale Pasta:
1 bunch 1/2 lb. kale
1/2 lb. angel hair pasta (can use wheat or white flour pasta)
2 Tbsp. olive oil
2 Tbsp. butter
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup grated Parmesan
Pinch salt and pepper
Pinch red pepper flakes (optional)

1. Pull the kale leaves from the woody stems and tear or cut them into small 1 to 2-inch pieces.
Rinse the kale well in a colander under cool, running water and allow it to drain.
2. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the pasta to the boiling water, and cook until al
dente (about 7 minutes). Drain the pasta in a colander.
3. While the pasta is cooking, add the olive oil, butter, and minced garlic to another large pot
or skillet. Cook over medium heat for 1-2 minutes, or until the garlic is soft and fragrant. Add
the kale and continue to sauté until the kale has wilted and has turned a deep green color
(about 5-7 minutes). Turn the heat off.
4. Add the drained pasta to the pot with the sautéed kale. Toss the pasta and kale together.
Allow them to cool to the point that steam is no longer rising from the pot. You want the pasta
warm, but not hot enough to melt the Parmesan.
5. Season the pasta and kale with salt and freshly cracked pepper to taste. Add the grated
Parmesan cheese and toss to coat. Add a pinch of red pepper flakes over top if desired.

For the Tomatoes:
1 pint of cherry tomatoes
1-2 tbsp. olive oil (or use the leftover oil in the pan you used to make the chicken)

1. Heat a skillet or pan over medium heat,
2. Add your tomatoes to the pan and cook stirring occasionally.
3. Cook until the tomato skins are blistered, bursting, and soft.

**Spaghetti and Broccoli Meal Prep**

For the spaghetti:
1 Tbsp. olive oil
1/2 lb. lean ground beef (optional)
1 yellow onion
2 cloves garlic
1 zucchini
2 carrots
1/2 tsp basil
1/2 tsp oregano
1/4 tsp salt
Freshly cracked pepper
Pinch red pepper flakes (optional)
24 oz. jar pasta sauce (of your choice)
12 oz. spaghetti

1. Add olive oil and ground beef to a large, deep skillet. Brown the ground beef over medium
heat until cooked through. If you are not using meat, disregard this step and move on to
sautéing the onion and garlic.
2. While the beef is browning, finely dice onion and mince the garlic. Once the beef has
cooked through, add the onion and garlic to the skillet and continue to sauté until the onion is
soft and transparent.
3. While the onion and garlic are sautéing, shred the zucchini and carrots using a large-holed
cheese grater. You should have about 1 to 1.5 cups of each vegetable.
4. Add the shredded zucchini and carrots to the skillet along with the basil, oregano, some
freshly cracked pepper, salt, and a pinch of red pepper (optional). Continue to sauté until the
vegetables are tender.
5. Add the pasta sauce and heat through. Cook the spaghetti according to the package
directions then drain in a colander. Return the drained spaghetti to the pot with the heat
turned off. Add one cup of the prepared sauce to the pasta and stir to coat. Divide the pasta
into serving bowls and top with additional sauce.

For the broccoli:
1 lb. frozen broccoli florets (can also use fresh)
2 Tbsp. olive oil
1 Tbsp. Montreal steak seasoning

1. Preheat oven to 400ºF. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil. Spread
the frozen florets out over the baking sheet (no need to thaw). If you are using fresh broccoli,
wash your florets and cut into smaller, bite sized pieces. Dry the florets before drizzling with
olive oil.
2. Drizzle the olive oil over the florets, then sprinkle the Montreal steak seasoning over top.
Toss the florets in the oil and seasoning until everything is evenly distributed.


3. Transfer the baking sheet to the oven and roast for 20 minutes. Take the baking sheet out
and use a spatula to stir the broccoli and redistribute the oil and spices. Return the baking sheet
to the oven and roast for another 10 minutes, or until the broccoli develops the amount of
brownness desired.

To combine:

1. After making each of these recipes, portion out desired amounts of each into separate
containers. This recipe will make about 4-5 servings depending on your portion sizes.
2. Store in fridge until ready to eat. Heat in microwave.

**Homemade Granola**

1 ½ cup brown sugar
½ cup water
4 tsp vanilla
½ tsp salt
8 cups oats
¾ cups chopped pecans
¾ cups chopped almonds
½ cup sunflower seeds (can also use flax seeds, chia seeds, or a combination of all three)
½ cup shredded unsweetened coconut

1. Microwave sugar and water on half power for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally until the sugar
dissolves. Stir in the vanilla and salt.
2. In a large bowl mix the dry ingredients starting with oats. Add the sugar mix and stir well.
3. Bake the mixture on 2 cookie sheets for 45 minutes at 275 °F. Rotate the sheets on the oven
racks every 15 minutes to prevent burning. With each switch, stir the granola gently.
4. Cool the granola completely before storing.


**Peanut Butter Granola Bars**

In a large bowl mix:
4 cups oatmeal
4 cups Rice Krispies (or ½ puffed rice with 1/2 rice krispies or mixture of whatever is in the
pantry to equal 4 cups of cereal)
3 ½ - 4 cups chopped nuts and/or dried fruit (almonds, sunflower seeds, flax seeds, pumpkin
seeds, chia seeds, raisons, craisons, coconut, millet...)

In a small sauce pan, heat:
1 cup peanut butter
1 cup honey
½ cup brown sugar (could substitute Xagave or your preferred sweetener)
1-2 tsp vanilla (depends on preference)

Heat until sugar and honey is dissolved into the peanut butter, and then mix with cereal, nut,
and fruit mixture. Stir until coated well, and then press onto a cookie sheet. Put it in the
refrigerator or freezer until firm. When firm cut it like granola bars from the store and put each
in a snack size baggie. These can be stored in the fridge or freezer.

*** This is very forgiving...you can mix and match with what you already have around your
house or apartment and it still does well. You can use Xagave or any other sweetener instead of
brown sugar or even add maple syrup. Just play around with the ratio of the sweeteners
because some are sweeter than others.

**Other Snack Ideas**
_If you don’t feel like taking the time and energy to make a snack, here are some easy ideas for
snacks that you don’t really have to put together. The key to a snack that will keep you
energized? Include a protein and a produce component. That easy!_

**Pesto Tortellini**

6-20 oz. cheese or spinach and cheese tortellini (amount depends on how much you want)
Bottle of pesto
1-1 ½ grilled or baked chicken breast (optional)

1. Cook the desired amount of pasta that you want. Once cooked, drain the tortellini and return
it back to the pot.
2. Add chicken if desired.
3. Add one or two spoonfuls of pesto and mix to combine everything. Add more pesto to your
liking and heat on low to medium heat until the mixture is warmed through. Serve immediately.

**Fish**
_Fish can seem intimidating to make, but it is really very simple because it doesn’t take very long
to cook. The hardest thing with fish is how expensive it can be. Look for sales on fish and freeze
a few filets for easy use later._

**How to Cook Most Types of Fish**
_These methods work well with fish like salmon, tilapia, Mahi Mahi, cod, and halibut._

Bake:

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F for thawed fish or 400°F for frozen fish. Spray a 9x9 or 13x9 inch
glass pan with cooking spray.
2. Season your fish filets as desired. Some ideas are lemon pepper seasoning, Cajun seasoning,
garlic and onion powder, butter and lemon, or whatever type of seasoning you like best. Add
the filets to the pan.
3. Bake for about 15-20 minutes or until the fish flakes easily with a fork.

Pan Fry:

1. Heat a sauté pan over medium heat. Pour about 1-1 ½ tablespoons of olive oil in the pan and
heat until the oil shimmers.
2. While the oil is heating, season your fish as desired (see above for some seasoning ideas).
3. Add your fish filets to the pan and cook for about 5-7 minutes on each side until the fish
flakes easily with a fork.


**Tacos or Burritos**
_Another quick and easy dinner idea is tacos or burritos. These can be made with any type of
meat (beef, chicken, pork, shrimp) or can easily be made vegetarian or vegan with rice, beans,
and veggies. Make your taco a salad by adding your toppings on to lettuce instead of a tortilla._

How to Cook Taco Meat:

1. Choose which type of meat you like best. You can cook your meat thawed or frozen.
2. Chicken can easily be baked in the oven at 375°F for around 35-40 minutes. Or you can pan
fry the chicken over the stove.
3. Ground beef is best cooked in a sauté pan. Once the meat is cooked until it is no longer pink,
drain the extra juice from the pan and pat the meat with a paper towel to remove additional
drippings.
4. Whatever type of meat you choose, season it with taco seasoning from a packet or make
your own by simply mixing all these ingredients together. 2-3 tbsp. of this mix is equivalent to a
packet of taco mix:
1/3 cup dry minced onion
2 tsp salt
2 tbsp. chili powder
2 tbsp. paprika
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp cumin
½ tsp oregano
2 tbsp. flour

Topping Ideas:
Lettuce
Tomato
Avocado or guacamole
Salsa
Cilantro
Sour cream or plain yogurt
Hot sauce


**Lentil Tacos**
_Here is super delicious vegetarian take on tacos using lentils, which are very high in protein._

½ tbsp. olive oil
1 cup finely chopped onion
1 clove garlic, minced
1 cup dried brown lentils, rinsed (check for small dirt clods and rocks)
1 package of low sodium taco seasoning (or make your own using the recipe on page 39)
2 ¼ cups water
Tortillas
Toppings of choice

1. In a large saucepan or skillet over medium-high heat, heat oil. Add the onion and garlic and
cook until the onions begin to soften.
2. Add lentils and taco seasoning to pan. Cook until the spices are fragrant and the lentils are
dry, about 1 minute or so.
3. Add the water to the lentils and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover the lentils, and
simmer until the lentils are tender and most of the liquid is gone, about 25-30 minutes but cook
longer if needed. Uncover the lentils and continue to cook until the mixture thickens, about 3-5
minutes more.
4. Once the lentils are cooked, make up your tacos with all your favorite toppings!

and let it sit for about 10 minutes to set a little bit more before serving. Add more salt and
pepper to your liking and shred a little cheese on top and a bit of fresh basil if desired.

**Oven Baked Sweet Potato Fries**

2 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon black pepper

1. Preheat oven to 400°F.
2. Cut the sweet potatoes into sticks ¼ to ½ inch wide and 3 inches long, and toss them with the
oil. You can make them thicker if you want more of a potato wedge rather than a fry.
3. Mix the spices, salt and pepper in a small bowl, and toss them with the oiled sweet potatoes.
Spread them out on 2 baking sheets so that they aren’t overlapping too much.
4. Bake until the potatoes are brown and crisp on the bottom, about 15 minutes, then flip and
cook until the other side is crisp, about 10 minutes. Serve hot.
5. Optional: you can sprinkle these with freshly grated parmesan cheese and parsley for a little
extra garnish if desired.
6. Note: you can also use regular potatoes with this recipe, but the cooking time may need to
be adjusted slightly so just watch the potatoes to make sure they are getting cooked enough to
be tender.

1/3 cup chopped fresh dill (you can also use dried dill, but use about 1-2 tbsp.)

## Easy Sides............................................................................................................................

1 tbsp. yeast
1 ¼ to 1 ½ cup warm water
2 tbsp. sugar
3 cups flour (can use white, wheat, or a mix of both)
1 tsp salt
1-2 tbsp. melted butter
Garlic powder, Parmesan cheese, parsley, add other seasonings as desired

1. Stir yeast, water, and sugar and let sit for 5 minutes. Stir in flour and salt and knead for 3
minutes (either by hand or in a stand mixer), adding more flour if needed.
2. Lightly grease a cookie sheet. Roll out dough to fit the pan. Melt butter and spread it on top
of the dough. Sprinkle with garlic powder, parmesan cheese, parsley, and any other desired
seasonings.
4. Slice with a pizza cutter. Make a cut halfway through the dough on the short side of the pan.
Then make cuts down the long side of the pan so that you have long breadsticks.
5. Let the breadsticks stand for 20 minutes to rise. Bake for 10-12 minutes until golden brown
at 400°F.


**Lion House Dinner Rolls**

2 tbsp. dry yeast (the equivalent of 2 packets)
2 cups warm water (110-115°F)
1/3 cup sugar
1/3 cup butter
2 ½ tsp. salt
2/3 c. nonfat dry milk
5-6 cups flour
1 egg

1. In the large bowl of an electric mixer, combine yeast and water. Let stand 5 minutes.
2. Add sugar, butter, salt, dry milk, 2 cups flour, and egg. Beat together until very smooth. Add 2
more cups flour, one at a time, and beat until smooth.
3. Add about one more cup flour, ½ cup at a time (in your mixer if it will take it, or by hand),
until it is well mixed in.
4. Turn dough onto a lightly floured cutting board or clean surface and knead until it is smooth
and satiny. Gather dough into a ball. Scrape bowl clean and grease it with butter. Return dough
to bowl and grease the dough surface lightly (could use cooking spray). Let the dough rise away
from drafts and in a warm place until about triple in bulk. (You can also let the dough rise in a
cool oven with a pan of hot water on a rack underneath the dough).
5. Use the last of the flour as needed on the cutting board or a clean surface for rolling and
shaping the dough. (Don’t use it all unless you need it). Let dough rest on board for 10 minutes
so it will be easier to manage if you roll it. Cut or mold into desired shapes. You can easily make
small round rolls or get fancier with some different shaping methods.
6. Place on greased baking sheets. Brush the surface of rolls with melted butter. Let the rolls
rise in a warm place until ready for the oven (about 1 ½ hours).
7. Bake at 400°F for 15-20 minutes, or until browned to your satisfaction. Recipe makes about 3
dozen rolls.

**Black Bean Quinoa Burgers**

2 tablespoons flax meal + 5 tablespoons water (this will make flax eggs; you can also use 2
regular eggs)
Coconut or olive oil for cooking
½ cup uncooked quinoa
1 small yellow onion, finely chopped
1 orange bell pepper, finely chopped
1 jalapeno pepper, seeds removed, finely chopped
1 tablespoon garlic, minced
1 cup packed spinach, chopped
1 can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 tsp salt
1 tsp paprika
½ tsp cumin
½ tsp pepper
⅛ tsp ground cayenne
½ cup oat flour (ground-up rolled oats), or regular flour

1. Preheat oven to 375°F. Lightly grease a baking sheet and set aside. Combine flax meal and
    water in a small bowl if you are making flax eggs and set aside in the fridge.
2. To cook quinoa, heat 1 teaspoon of oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Rinse quinoa
    in a small mesh strainer until the water running off of it runs clear. Once oil is hot, add
    quinoa to the saucepan and stir. Cook for 1-2 minutes until lightly toasted. Add 1 cup water
    and turn the heat to high. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 13-
    15 minutes or until the quinoa is tender and the small fibers are starting to separate.
3. While the quinoa is cooking, heat about 1 tablespoon of oil in a skillet over medium heat.
    Once hot, add chopped onion and let it cook until it begins to soften, about 5-7 minutes.
    Add the bell pepper, jalapeño, and garlic and cook until the onion is translucent and the
    other vegetables are softening, about 5-7 minutes. Add the spinach and stir immediately,
    letting it wilt slightly. Turn the heat off.
4. In a large bowl, add black beans and mash them with a fork, leaving some texture. Add the
    cooked quinoa, sautéed vegetables, salt, paprika, cumin, pepper, cayenne, and reserved
    flax eggs or regular eggs if you are using those. Mix until combined then add oat flour or
    regular flour and stir everything together. The mixture will be sticky, but should still pull
    together slightly.
5. Form 10-12 patties depending on desired size. Place on baking sheet and bake for 20
    minutes, flip, then bake for 25-30 more minutes, until browned and crispy.
6. These can be served on a whole-wheat hamburger bun with guacamole, barbecue sauce,
    and other desired toppings, on top of a salad, in a lettuce wrap, or folded up in a warmed
    tortilla with avocado and lettuce.

4 oz. bacon or pancetta*
3 cloves garlic, finely diced or minced
2 tbsp. flour
2 cups milk
¾ tsp salt

crisp. Remove the bacon or pancetta from pan and set on paper towels to drain. Reserve about

**Freezer Black Bean Quinoa Burritos**
_These burritos take a bit of time to make and assemble, but the end product is so delicious that
it’s worth it! This recipe is vegetarian and can be made gluten free by using a gluten free tortilla
and vegan by omitting the cheese._

2 tbsp. olive oil
1 large yellow onion, diced
4 cloves garlic, finely minced or crushed
½ - 1 jalapeño seeded and finely minced
1 large red bell pepper, diced
1 medium zucchini, diced
1 cup corn kernels fresh, frozen, or canned
1 large tomato, diced
1 cup cooked quinoa (made from about ½ cup uncooked)
3 cups cooked black beans (about 2 cans)
1 tbsp. ground cumin
1 tsp hot smoked paprika or regular paprika
1 tsp chili powder
1 tsp salt
½ a bunch of cilantro chopped, optional
1 cup shredded jalapeño cheese or cheese or your preference, optional
6 large whole wheat tortillas*

1. Cut all the vegetables that need to be cut and set aside in small bowls or on plates.
2. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions and sauté for about 6-8
minutes, stirring frequently, until the onions are soft and beginning to take on a bit of color.
Add the garlic and jalapeños and sauté for about 2 minutes more.
3. Add zucchini and red pepper and sauté for 8-10 minutes. The vegetables should be softened
but not mushy and just starting to brown.
4. Add the corn, and tomato and sauté for 2-3 minutes, until the mixture is well heated. Add the
quinoa, black beans, cumin, smoked paprika, chili powder, and salt. Stir everything to combine
well and heat through.
5. Taste the mixture and adjust seasonings if necessary. Stir in the cilantro, and remove from
the heat.
6. Once the veggie filling is done, you have a few options: serve the burritos immediately, serve
some of the burritos and freeze the rest, or freeze all the burritos. If you're freezing the
burritos, fill the tortillas with the mixture and sprinkle with cheese if desired, roll them up so
that the ends are closed up, and wrap individually in foil or parchment paper, and place in a
single layer in the freezer.
*NOTE: this easily makes more than 6 burritos so have more tortillas on hand if you want to
freeze these. You will likely end up with more or less burritos depending on how full you fill
them and or if you decide to set some of the mix aside to keep in the fridge.

1 cup pineapple juice (can be drained from canned pineapple)
¼ - ½ c. packed brown sugar
1/3 c. low sodium soy sauce
2 pounds chicken breast tenderloins or strips
Skewers

1. In a small saucepan over medium heat, mix pineapple juice, brown sugar, and soy sauce.

oven. Preheat your oven to 375°F to 400°F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place the
tenders on the foil and put the pan in the oven. Cook for 15 minutes, turn the chicken and cook
15 minutes more. Juices should run clear and the internal temperature of the chicken should be
165°F and should hold at that temperature for 15-30 seconds.

**Roast**
_Oven roasted meat is really delicious and is actually very easy to make. This is a simple recipe for
how to roast meat in the oven, but you can also do this in a crockpot if you prefer. If using a
crockpot, brown the sides of your cut of meat, place it in the crockpot with about a cup of water,
and let it cook on low for about 6 hours. You can also add in some veggies to make a complete
meal!_

1 oven roast, 2 lbs. (beef, pork loin, or turkey breast)
Coarse salt
Ground pepper

1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Prepare the roast by setting it on a roasting rack in a shallow baking
pan. Rub salt and pepper over the roast as needed.
2. Place roast in the oven and cook for about 1 to 1 ½ hours, or until a meat thermometer
inserted in the center reads the appropriate temperature— 150 -155°F or beef and pork, 165°F
for turkey).

**Easy Pizza Dough**

2 ½ cups flour
½ tbsp. yeast
1 cup warm water
½ tbsp. sugar
½ tsp. salt

minutes while yeast bubbles and activates (if using active dry).
3. Add in the remaining ingredients and knead or mix until the dough is well combined and pulls
easily from the side of your bowl. Let dough rise for about 15-20 minutes while you prepare
your toppings.
4. Roll out your pizza dough onto a sheet pan or a pizza stone. Roll the dough thinner if you
want a crispier crust, thicker if you want a fluffier crust. Depending on the size of your pan or
pizza stone, you may or may not have leftover dough to make a second smaller pizza.

want to cook the crust for just 6-7 minutes.
6. Once your crust has been cooked, add your desired toppings and then cook for about 10-12
minutes or until all ingredients are heated through and cheese is melted (if you are using
cheese). Watch the crust while it is baking to make sure that it doesn’t burn, especially if you
are making a thinner crust.

This is where the filling will go so make it wide enough, but don’t cut through the bottom of the
apples.
2. In a small bowl, combine the sugar, cinnamon, dried fruit, and pecans. Place the apples in a
square baking dish (8x8 or 9x9 both work well). Stuff each apple with the filling mixture and top
each with a dot of butter (about 1 tsp for each).
3. Add boiling water or apple juice to the baking dish and cover with foil. Bake for 30-40
minutes, until the apples are tender, but not mushy. Remove the dish from the over and baste
the apples with the pan juices several times. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream, whipped
cream, or vanilla yogurt if desired.

**Additional Resources**

This recipe book is a _very_ basic start to giving you some resources to help you feel

confident in preparing healthy, homemade meals from your apartment or home. Of course, this

does not even begin to scratch the surface of all the healthy recipes that are available. So

where can you go for more ideas if you can’t find something you’re looking for here? Try some

of the following resources:

 **Pinterest** : Just type in whatever you are thinking about making and you will find dozens to

```
thousands of recipe ideas. This is also a great way to find food blogs or other recipe
websites. You can even type in key words like “healthy”, “college-friendly”, “vegetarian” to
recipes that fall into that category.
```
 **Allrecipes.com** : This is another website similar to Pinterest, but it is only for recipes. It’s a

```
great community based website and most recipes have ideas for how to adapt them or
adjust them. Recipes are also given reviews so you can search for recipes that are 4 or 5
stars and know that you are likely going to end up with a really good recipe.
```
 **Budgetbytes.com** : Budget Bytes is a website full of recipes created for people on a

```
budget—hence most college students! Beyond having a wide variety of recipes, the author
includes how much each recipe costs. The website also offers some additional resources
including how-to tutorials, tips on what cooking utensils and equipment you should own,
and more.
```
 **Local Library** : Going to the library isn’t as simple as looking up a recipe on your phone.

```
However, there is just something fun about reading through and cooking from an actual
cookbook and the library is the perfect place to find some great ones.
```
 **Family/Friends** : Ask family or friends for their favorite recipes, especially if you know that

```
they make really good food. Beyond getting some great recipes, you might also learn some
new tips and tricks that you can use as you expand your cooking skills.
