Did you know that 1 in 6 Americans will get sick from food poisoning this year? Food poisoning not only sends
128,000 Americans to the hospital each year, it can also have long-term health effects.
The keys to basic food safety are cooking it to the right temperature and handling it properly. Follow these
guidelines to keep you, your family, and your guests safe.
For more information on these and other food safety guidelines, please visit [http://www.foodsafety.gov.](http://www.foodsafety.gov.)
**Practice Good Hygiene**
Use hot water and regular soap to wash your hands. Scrub the backs
of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails for at least
20 seconds. Need a timer? Try humming the “Happy Birthday” song
from beginning to end twice. Rinse hands, then dry with a clean towel.
Wash your hands often, especially during these key times when germs
can spread:

- Before, during, and after preparing food
- Before serving food or eating
- After handling raw meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, or their juices
- After using the toilet, touching garbage, touching an animal or
    picking something up off the floor
- After changing a diaper or taking care of someone who is sick
- After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing

**Cook to Safe Temperatures**

Cook all food to the minimum safe internal temperatures on the chart above. Use a food thermometer to be sure

your food is safe. When you think your food is done, place the food thermometer in the thickest part of the food,
making sure not to touch bone, fat, or gristle.

```
Safe Internal Food Temperatures
Poultry
Whole or Pieces 165°F
Ground 165°F
Beef, Pork, and Lamb
Steaks/Roasts/Chops 145°F
Ground 160°F
Pre-Cooked Ham 140°F
Seafood
Fish Fillet/Whole Fish 145°F
Shrimp/Lobster/Crab Cook until
flesh is pearly
```
```
Leftovers and Casseroles 165°F
Egg Dishes 160°F
```
## Cooking Safely


**3** (^)
**Separate Hazardous Foods**
Use one cutting board for hazardous foods (e.g. raw meat, poultry,
seafood, eggs) and another for non-hazardous foods (e.g. fresh
produce, cooked foods, foods that won’t be cooked).
Use separate plates and utensils for cooked and raw foods. Use hot,
soapy water to wash all plates, utensils, and cutting boards that
touched hazardous foods before using them again.
**Refrigerate and Freeze Properly**
Your refrigerator should be set to 40°F or below and your freezer to
0°F or below. Use a refrigerator and/or freezer thermometer to be
sure. Place raw meat, poultry, and seafood on plates, in containers, or
in sealed plastic bags. Freeze them if you’re not planning to use them
within a few days. Freezing does not kill harmful germs, but it does
keep food safe until you can cook it.
**Avoid the Danger Zone**
Bacteria that cause food poisoning grow quickest between 41°F and
135°F, also known as the danger zone. Never leave perishable foods
at room temperature for more than two hours. If the food is exposed
to temperatures above 90°F, refrigerate it within one hour.
If you’re not serving food right after cooking, keep it out of the
temperature danger zone by using a heat source like a chafing dish,
warming tray, or slow cooker. Cold foods can be kept on ice or in a
cooler for longer serving times.
Never thaw or marinate foods at room temperature. The safest way
to thaw or marinate is in the refrigerator. Leftovers should be placed
in small shallow containers and refrigerated promptly to allow for
quick cooling.
**Wash Produce**
Cut away any damaged or bruised areas on fruits and vegetables, then rinse under warm running water. Scrub
firm produce like melons, potatoes, or cucumbers with a clean produce brush. Air dry or pat dry with a paper
towel or clean cloth towel. Don’t rinse raw meat, poultry, seafood, or shell eggs.
**When In Doubt, Throw It Out**
The germs that make you sick are not always the same ones that cause food to go bad. Don’t use smell, taste, and
appearance as your only guides. Use the storage times on the table above to guide you. If you’re still not sure
whether a food item is safe, it’s better to be safe than sorry and throw it away.
**Safe Food Storage Times
(Refrigerated at 40°F or Below)
Raw Poultry**
Whole, Pieces, or
Ground
1 - 2 days
**Raw Beef, Pork, and Lamb**
Steaks/Roasts/Chops 3 - 5 days
Pre-Cooked Ham 3 - 4 days
Ground 1 - 2 days
Stew Meat 1 - 2 days
**Raw Seafood**
Fish Fillet/Whole Fish 1 - 2 days
Shrimp/Lobster/Crab 1 - 2 days
**Raw Eggs**
In shell 3 - 5 weeks
Out of Shell 2 - 4 days
**Cooked Leftovers**
Beef, Pork, and Lamb 3 - 4 days
Poultry 3 - 4 days
Seafood 3 - 4 days
Egg Dishes 3 - 4 days
Hard-Cooked Eggs, In 7 days
Vegetables and Fruit 5 - 7 days

**Recipe Notes**

- This recipe also does very well in a pressure cooker. Follow steps 1-4 on “sauté” mode, then add the chicken, seal
    the lid, and pressure cook on high for 20 minutes. Allow the pressure to release naturally after cooking.
- Instead of the allspice, a spice blend may be used such as Ras el Hanout, garam masala, or Chinese five-spice.

```
Prep: 15 minutes | Cook: 20 minutes | Total: 35 minutes
Yield: 4 servings | Serving Size: 1 kebab
Region: Africa | Country: Egypt
```
**Ingredients**

Warm water

½ medium onion (or 1 small onion)

½ teaspoon salt

½ teaspoon ground black pepper

½ teaspoon ground turmeric

½ teaspoon lemon juice or apple cider vinegar

1 pinch baking soda

1 pound (16 ounces) lean ground turkey
(90% lean or higher)

```
Directions
```
1. Fill a 9x13-inch baking dish about halfway with warm water.
    Place four wooden skewers in the water and set aside.
2. Peel the onion, then grate it using a box grater. Press with
    paper towels to remove the excess juice.
3. Add the onion, salt, black pepper, turmeric, lemon juice or
    vinegar, baking soda, and ground turkey to a medium
    mixing bowl. Knead the mixture until it is dough-like in
    texture, about 5 minutes, then divide into four portions.
4. Fill a small bowl or liquid measuring cup about halfway with
    water. Dampen your clean hands with the water, shaking
    off any excess, then take each portion of the turkey mixture
    and roll it into a sausage-like shape, about 4-5 inches long.
5. Push a skewer lengthwise into each portion of the turkey
    mixture. Squeeze the mixture gently, spreading it evenly to
    be about 7-8 inches long and ⅔-inch-thick. Using your
    thumb and pointer finger, make indentations about 1 inch
    apart down the length of each kebab.
6. Cook the kebabs on an outdoor (gas/charcoal) or indoor
    (electric) grill over medium-high heat until cooked through
    (internal temperature of 165°F), about 4-5 minutes on each
    side. Serve warm.

```
Prep: 10 minutes | Cook: 15 minutes | Total: 25 minutes
Yield: 4 servings | Serving Size: 1 cup
Region: North America | Country: Mexico
```
**Ingredients**

1 tablespoon olive oil

2 medium tomatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces
(about 2 cups)

½ medium onion, diced (about ½ cup)

1 jalapeño, seeded and minced

¼ teaspoon salt

2 medium zucchini, trimmed, halved lengthwise
and cut into 1-inch chunks (about 4 cups)

1 cup frozen corn

2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro

½ lime, juiced (about 1 tablespoon)

```
Directions
```
1. Heat a large skillet or sauté pan over medium-high heat.
2. Add the oil and heat until shimmering.
3. Add the tomatoes, onion, jalapeño, and salt.
4. Cook, stirring often, until the tomatoes release their juice
    and the onion is softened, about 5-7 minutes.
5. Add the zucchini and corn.
6. Increase the heat to high and cook, stirring occasionally,
    until the zucchini is just starting to soften and the corn is
    thawed, about 6-8 minutes.

**Recipe Notes**

- A little charring on the vegetables is okay and adds a nice flavor.
- If a crust forms on the bottom of the pan, use a rubber spatula to scrape it up and mix it into the vegetables.
    Adding the lime juice at the end will help to remove any that is still stuck on.

## Basic Guacamole – Mexico

```
Prep: 10 minutes | Cook: 0 minutes | Total: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings | Serving Size: ¼ cup without add-ins
Region: North America | Country: Mexico
```
**Ingredients**

2 large avocados (or 3 medium avocados)

2 tablespoons minced or grated onion

1 clove garlic, minced (about ½ teaspoon)

1 tablespoon lime juice (about ½ lime)

¼ teaspoon salt

Optional add-ins: 1 cup finely chopped ripe
mango, ½ cup diced bell pepper, ½ cup diced
tomato, ¼ cup minced fresh cilantro or parsley,
1 seeded and minced jalapeño pepper,
1 teaspoon lime zest

```
Directions
```
1. Cut the avocados in half, lengthwise around the pit, cutting
    on a cutting board and away from the body.
2. Remove the pit from the avocados by pressing gently on the
    avocado skin that is directly behind the pit.
3. Using a spoon, scoop the flesh out of the skin and into a
    medium mixing bowl. Use a fork or potato masher to mash
    the avocado into a smooth, slightly lumpy consistency.
4. Add the onion, lime juice, salt, and selected add-in(s) (if
    using). Stir to combine.
5. Serve right away or store for later use (see Recipe Notes).

**Recipe Notes**

- Guacamole will brown when exposed to air for too long. To minimize browning, store with plastic wrap pressed
    directly on the surface of the guacamole and place in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
- Guacamole goes well with whole-grain tortilla chips, as a topping on a variety of dishes, or as a spread for a wrap
    or sandwich.
- A mortar and pestle can be used to mash the avocado, if desired.
- For a smoother consistency, combine all ingredients in a food processor and blend together.

Prep: 10 minutes | Cook: 20 minutes | Total: 30 minutes
Yield: 8 servings | Serving Size: 1 slice without toppings
Region: Oceania | Country: New Zealand
```
**Ingredients**

1 cup powdered sugar, divided

4 eggs, plus more if needed (see step 2)

⅛ teaspoon cream of tartar

1 tablespoon cornstarch

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

1 cup whipped cream (store-bought or
homemade)

½ cup lemon curd (store-bought or homemade;
can substitute another fruit curd)

Optional toppings: Fresh fruit, chopped if
needed (e.g. pomegranate seeds, raspberries,
blueberries, strawberries), mint leaves
(optional)

```
Directions
```
1. Preheat the oven to 325°F. Line a baking sheet with
    parchment paper and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of the
    powdered sugar, then set aside.
2. Carefully crack one of the eggs and separate the white from
    the yolk into a small bowl. If any yolk gets into the white,
    discard and start with a new egg. If the white is free of yolk,
    transfer it to a large mixing bowl. Repeat until you have
    4 egg whites in the bowl. Save the yolks for another use.
3. Add the cream of tartar. Using an electric mixer (or
    whisking by hand, if needed) beat until stiff peaks form.
4. In a separate bowl whisk together cornstarch and ¾ cup of
    the powdered sugar Add to the whipped egg whites, gently
    folding to combine.
5. Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking sheet and
    spread into an even layer. Bake on the middle rack until set
    and lightly golden-brown, about 12-15 minutes.
6. Meanwhile, place a second sheet of parchment paper on
    the counter and sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons
    of powdered sugar.
7. Quickly and carefully, flip the baked egg white mixture
    (meringue) onto the second sheet of parchment paper. Let
    cool, then carefully peel away the paper it was baked on.
8. Spread the lemon curd over the meringue, then spread the
    whipped cream on top. Carefully roll into a log, starting
    from one of the narrow end, then cut into 8 slices.
9. Serve right away or chill before serving. Top as desired.

Yield: 2 servings | Serving Size: 1 salmon fillet with an egg and half the spinach
Region: Eastern Europe | Country: Sweden
```
```
Ingredients
Water
Nonstick cooking spray
2 eggs
2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives, divided
2 (4-ounce) salmon fillets
4 cups fresh spinach (about 4 ounces, or 1 cup
frozen spinach)
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted, divided
2 teaspoons lemon juice, divided
2 pinches (about ⅛ teaspoon) salt, divided
2 pinches (about ⅛ teaspoon) ground black
pepper, divided
```
```
Directions
```
1. Fill a medium saucepan about halfway full with water and
    bring to a boil.
2. Meanwhile, coat the inside of two oven-safe ramekins or
    other small dishes with nonstick cooking spray. Crack an egg
    into each dish and top each with 1 tablespoon of the chives.
3. Set the egg dishes in the bottom of a slow cooker, then add
    the salmon fillets on either side.
4. Pour the boiling water into the slow cooker until it comes
    about halfway up the sides of the egg dishes – be careful
    not to get any water in the egg cups.
5. Cover the slow cooker with the lid and cook on high for
    1 hour. Check for doneness (see Recipe Notes). If needed,
    cook for an additional 10-15 minutes.
6. Use oven mitts to carefully remove the egg dishes. Then, lift
    the salmon out with a slotted spatula or spoon. Set aside.
7. Add the spinach to the slow cooker and stir into the water
    until wilted, about 3-4 minutes. Drain or lift out of the slow
    cooker with tongs and divide between two plates.
8. Add ½ tablespoon of the melted butter to each portion of
    spinach. Toss to combine. Top each portion with one of the
    salmon fillets.
9. Use a butter knife to loosen the eggs from the dishes and
    place each on top of the salmon.
10. Sprinkle each plate with 1 teaspoon of the lemon juice,
    1 pinch of the salt, and 1 pinch of the black pepper. Serve
    warm.

**Recipe Notes**

- The salmon is done when it reaches an
    internal temperature of 145°F or flakes easily
    with a fork. The eggs are done when the
    whites and yolk do not jiggle when the
    dishes are shaken.
- For best results, serve right away. If needed,
    this recipe will keep in the refrigerator for up
    to 2 days. To reheat, cook in the microwave
    at 50% power until warm, about 1½- 3
    minutes.

## Herb and Spice Substitutions


**76** (^)
Spices typically come from the berries, seeds, roots, or bark of plants. When dried for packaging and cooking, their
flavors intensify. Spices can be purchased whole or ground.
**Using Whole Spices**
Buying spices whole and then grinding them as needed keeps them fresher for longer, up to 2 years. Examples of
whole spices are cardamom pods, whole cloves, cumin seeds, and peppercorns.
If using whole spices in a dish, make sure to remove and discard them before serving. Placing the whole spices in a
sachet or a little pouch made from cheesecloth can make this process easier.
To grind spices from their whole form:

1. Place the whole spices in a coffee grinder (reserve this grinder for spices only).
2. Pulse the spices in the grinder until they are finely ground.
3. Sift the ground spices to remove any large or hard bits.
4. Use right away or store in an airtight container in a cool, dark place for up to 1 year.
5. (Optional) To fully clean the grinder between spices, place torn up pieces of bread in the grinder. Pulse to move
    the bread around in the grinder, which will allow it to pick up any leftover spice residue. Remove and discard the
    bread, or toast it to make breadcrumbs. (Note: If you cannot have bread for any reason, rice can be used to clean
    the grinder instead.)
6. Wipe out the grinder with a damp cloth and wipe it dry. Put it away or use it for another spice.

**Toasting Spices**

If using whole spices, they can be toasted in a dry skillet to bring out their flavors before grinding them.

**Blooming Spices**

Many of the flavors in spices can only come out when they are combined with a fat. Blooming spices is a technique
that involves cooking whole or ground spices in a little oil over medium-low heat to bring out their best flavor.

If cooking aromatic vegetables, such as onions and garlic, the spices can be added at the same time.

Adding herbs to the dishes you make is an excellent way to bring in a new world of flavor without adding extra salt.
Herbs come in a variety of forms and varieties, and can be used to bring out the best in many types of recipes.
The most common forms of herbs available are fresh and dried. Fresh herbs can be used to bring in a bright or
hearty flavor, depending on the variety used. Dried herbs lend deep, complex flavors to dishes and are certainly
more convenient to use than fresh herbs.
**Substituting Dried Herbs for Fresh Herbs**
It is important to keep in mind that dried herbs do best in recipes with long cooking times (20 minutes or more).
Dried herbs will not work in dishes that must use herbs raw (e.g. pesto) or when needed to finish a dish.

- 1 part whole dried herbs = 3 parts fresh herbs (example: use 1 teaspoon dried whole herb in place of
    1 tablespoon fresh herb)
- 1 part ground/rubbed dried herbs = 4 parts fresh herbs (example: use ¼ teaspoon dried ground or rubbed herb in
    place of 1 teaspoon fresh herb)

**Hardy Herbs (e.g. Rosemary, Oregano, Thyme, Sage, Marjoram)**

Some herbs have a hardy, almost woody texture. The leaves are sturdy and the stems can be tough. They are potent

and only a small amount of these herbs is needed to flavor a dish (usually fractions of teaspoons to a tablespoon).
Dried versions of these herbs work well in cooking.

These herbs benefit from long cooking to release maximum flavor and ensure that their texture is not unpleasant.
Add these herbs at the beginning of cooking.

**Delicate Herbs (e.g. Basil, Cilantro, Dill, Chives, Mint, Parsley, Tarragon)**

Other herbs have a delicate, leafy texture. The stems are tender, and can even be edible. Delicate herbs are prone to

wilting and discoloration, and their flavor tends to quickly disappear when cooked. They tend to have a mild flavor
so a larger amount is often needed to flavor a dish (usually tablespoons to fractions of a cup).

These herbs are best used to finish dishes or used raw in sauces. Add these herbs at the end of cooking, or use as a

garnish.

**How to Preserve Fresh Herbs**
Sometimes we might harvest or purchase more fresh herbs than we can use right away. Rather than let them go to
waste, here are three ways to save your fresh herbs for later:
**Air Drying:** Works best for hardy herbs.

1. Shake the fresh herbs to remove any dirt. You can gently wash the herbs, but be sure to dry them well afterward
    to prevent mold growth.
2. Secure the herb stems together using twine or a rubber band.
3. Hang the herbs upside down in a warm, dry, well-ventilated place away from sunlight. If you don't have a dark

```
spot, or if dust is a concern, cover the bundle loosely with a paper bag.
```
4. Leave the herbs to dry until the leaves crumble, anywhere from 1-4 weeks. Store in an airtight container for up
    to 1 year.

**Freezing:** The best option for both delicate herbs and hardy fresh herbs.

- **Method A**
    1. Wash and dry the fresh herbs.
    2. Chop the fresh herbs.
    3. Pack the chopped herbs into an ice cube tray.
    4. Top the herbs off with oil, broth, or water. Oil is best for preventing freezer burn.
    5. Freeze the herbs, then pop out the cubes.
    6. Store the frozen herb cubes in an airtight container in the freezer for up to 3 months.
- **Method B**
    1. Wash and dry the fresh herbs.
    2. Blend the fresh herbs into a paste with a little oil, broth, or water. Oil is best for preventing freezer burn.
    3. Pack the herb paste into an ice cube tray.
    4. Freeze the herb paste, then pop out the cubes.
    5. Store the frozen herb paste cubes in an airtight container in the freezer for up to 3 months.

One of the biggest reasons why dishes prepared from written recipes go wrong is because the cook did not actually
read the recipe.
We often scan recipes and make grocery lists from them, but we do not always gather all of the information we
need. This is especially important when making something for the first time.
Following these simple steps, each time you read a recipe, can help you be more successful:

**1. Sit Down**

Sit down and simply read the recipe all the way through.
Do not take notes or make lists. Just read.

**2. Read It Again**

Highlight any special steps that you might need to do in
advance (e.g. bring cold ingredients to room
temperature, soaking).

Pay attention to punctuation. For instance, “1 cup sifted
flour” is not the same as “1 cup flour, sifted”.

Also take note of how the recipe writer wants you to
measure; by weight or by volume. For example, 6 ounces

of brown sugar is not the same as ¾ cup brown sugar.

**3. Gather Equipment**

Do this before you actually decide to cook the recipe,
just in case you need to go out and purchase something

that you do not have.

**4. Gather Ingredients**
Place all of the ingredients that you need in one area,
whether it is in the pantry, freezer, or refrigerator.
Anything that is missing will go on your grocery list.
During this step, pay attention to ingredients that may
need to be thawed or brought to room temperature.
**5. Note the Order of Steps**
Heat the oven and/or pans before you focus on anything
else. This will save you time and ensure a better end
result. Keep in mind that most recipe writers list the
ingredients in the order that they will be used, typically
from largest amount to smallest.
**6. Triple Check Cooking Times and
“Doneness Indicators”**
Make sure to set a timer as a guideline. That being said,
your senses can tell you more than a timer ever will. If
the food should look or smell a certain way, use that to
decide when it is done.

## Reading a Recipe


**83** (^)
**Typical Recipe Outline**
The structure of a recipe is more like an instruction manual than a book. It is a set of steps that should be followed in
a certain way to prepare a food or drink. Once you know how to read a recipe, you are well on your way to start
cooking!
Most home cooking recipes look something like this:
**Recipe Title
Yield or Number of servings** (Will you need more than this
or less than this?)
**Prep time, Cook time, Total time** (When do you need to
start to have it done when you are ready to eat?)
**(Sometimes) Difficulty level
Ingredients**
Look here for the food ingredients you will need.
Pay attention to special instructions here that may not be mentioned in the
directions (e.g. beans, drained and rinsed or carrots, chopped).
Some ingredients may be listed as optional or “to taste”.
**(Sometimes) Equipment needed**
Look here for any special kitchen utensils and cookware you might need to make the
recipe.
**Directions**
Look here for the steps that should be completed, in a certain order, to make the
recipe.
**(Sometimes) Recipe Notes**
Look here for tips, shortcuts, storage guidelines, and advice for making substitutions or
modifications.
**(Sometimes) Nutrition Information**
Look here to find out the nutrition information of the recipe (usually per one serving).

Try to cut food into pieces of the same (or very similar) shape and size. This helps the food cook evenly and makes
the dish more enjoyable – both in appearance and in taste.
**Standard Dice
What:** To cut food into cubes, which can vary in size from small to large.
**How:**

1. Trim and peel the vegetables if needed.
2. Cut the slices to the thickness that you wish the finished dice to be.
3. Stack the slices on top of one another and make even parallel cuts, going

```
lengthwise (long direction) to make sticks as thick as you want the dice to be.
```
4. Gather the sticks together and make cuts across the sticks (crosswise, or

```
short direction). Try to make each slice about the same thickness.
```
**Onion Dice**

**What:** The result is the same as with dicing any other food – small or large cubes.
The technique, however, is a little bit different.

**How:**

1. Cut off the “stem” end of the onion, keeping the “root” end intact.
2. Place the flat end that you just cut on the cutting board and cut the onion in
    half – going directly through the middle of the root – lengthwise.
3. Peel off the paper-like skin.
4. Take one half and make slices, going towards the “root” end. Do not cut all the way through the root end; about
    80 - 90% of the way back.
5. Turn the onion 90° and make slices across the first slices.
6. Repeat Steps 4-5 with the other half if needed.

## Basic Knife Cuts


**85** (^)
**Slice
What:** To cut flat, thin pieces.
**How:**

1. Trim and peel the vegetable if necessary. A slice can be removed from the

```
bottom or side to make it sit flat on the cutting board.
```
2. Slowly cut down crosswise (short direction) or lengthwise (long direction) –

```
from the top to bottom – to create pieces that are as thick or thin as you want
them.
```
**Rounds**

**What:** This shape is made when you slice a vegetable that is naturally round, such

as a carrot or potato.

**How:**

1. Trim and peel the vegetable if necessary. A slice can be removed from the
    bottom or side to make it sit flat on the cutting board.
2. Make parallel slicing cuts through the vegetable. Try to keep the thickness

```
about the same with each cut.
```
**Bias (Diagonal) Cut**

**What:** To slice a food at an angle (usually about 45°). This cut is often used to

prepare vegetables for stir-fries and other Asian-style dishes because the extra
surface area allows the vegetable to cook more quickly. It can also be helpful to
make raw foods, such as cucumbers, easier to dip.

**How:**

1. Trim and peel the vegetable if necessary
2. Hold the blade so that it is cutting through the food at an angle. The wider the
    angle the wider the cut surface will be.

**Snip**

**What:** To cut food (e.g. fresh herbs, green onions, dried fruit) into slices or small

pieces with kitchen shears or food-only scissors.

**How:** Using short, quick strokes with your kitchen shears or food-only scissors, cut

the item until it is as thin or as small as you want it to be.


**86** (^)
**Chop
What:** To cut foods with into smaller pieces without a specific shape.
**How:**

1. Trim the root and stem ends and peel the vegetables if necessary.
2. Slice or cut through the vegetables at nearly regular intervals until the cuts are
    relatively uniform. This does not have to be a perfect cut, but all the pieces
    should be roughly the same size.

**Mince (Fine Chop)**

**What:** A very fine chop that works for many vegetables, especially garlic and herbs.
When mincing herbs, rinse and dry well, and strip the leaves from the stems.

**How:**

1. Gather the food item(s) into a pile.
2. Coarsely chop the food into smaller pieces.
3. Place your guiding hand on the back of the knife to hold the tip of the knife in
    contact with the cutting board, over the pile of items.
4. Lower the knife firmly and rapidly, repeatedly cutting through the item.
    Continue cutting until the pieces are as small as you want.

**Chiffonade (Ribbons)**

**What:** To cut herbs, leafy greens, and other ingredients into very thin shreds.

**How:**

1. For large, loose leaves, roll individual leaves into tight cylinders before cutting.

```
For smaller leaves, simply stack before cutting.
```
2. Make very thin slices to create fine shreds.

**Julienne (Matchsticks) or Bâttonet (Dipping Sticks)**

**What:** To cut into long, rectangular strips. Julienne cuts are thin and short (left),

while bâtonnet cuts are thick and long (right).

**How:**

1. Cut the item into a short or long rectangle – short for julienne, long for
    bâtonnet.
2. Slice lengthwise (long direction) as thin for or as thick as you want – thinner for

```
julienne, thicker for bâtonnet.
```
