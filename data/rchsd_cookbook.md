### MyPlate Tips

######  Choose foods from all five food groups to get all the

###### energy, vitamins, and minerals you need.

######  Fill half your plate with fruits and veggies.

######  Make half your grains whole grains. Whole grains

###### include whole wheat bread, brown rice, whole

###### wheat pasta, and popcorn.

######  Choose low-fat and fat-free dairy foods.

######  Eat a variety of different protein foods.

######  Start with small changes.

######  Support family and friends to eat better too.

######  Look at the Nutrition Facts Panel (food label) to find

###### foods lower in saturated fat and added sugars. This

###### can help manage calories and prevent becoming

###### overweight or obese.

######  Choose foods with less sodium (salt) to help reduce

###### the risk of high blood pressure.

######  Take your time eating and pay attention to how you

###### feel. Stop eating when you are full so you do not

###### overeat.


### Food Safety Tips

###### There are four important steps to keep in mind when

###### preparing food safely: clean, separate, cook, and chill.

###### Read the tips below for more information on the four

###### steps

**1. Clean**
 Wash your hands before and after preparing food. Use soap

and warm water for at least 20 seconds.
 Wash your cutting boards, cooking tools, dishes, and

```
counters with soapy water before and after preparing food.
```
 Rinse fresh fruits and vegetables under running tap water
before eating.

 Keep purses, bags, and backpacks off counters where food is

```
prepared.
```
**2. Separate**

 Separate raw meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs from other
food in your grocery cart, grocery bags, and in your
refrigerator.

 Use separate cutting boards for meat and produce.
 Place cooked food on a clean plate, not one that held the

```
meat before it was cooked.
```
###### Desserts

```

```

 1 can black beans, drained and rinsed

```
```
Steps:
```
1. Preheat _oven_ to 350 degrees.
2. Using _blender_ , puree beans with water and oil. Mix cake mix in a

3. Using a _teaspoon_ or _cookie scoop_ portion cookie batter on _baking_
    _sheet_ coated with cooking spray.
4. Bake 8 minutes.
5. Let cool ten minutes on baking sheets.

```
Frozen Yogurt Covered Fruit
Makes 4 servings
```
```

```
```
Steps:
```
1. Remove stems from strawberries.
    Cut strawberries in half.
2. Dip strawberries and blueberries in yogurt. Place on a _baking sheet_
    lined with _parchment or wax paper_.
3. Place baking sheet in _freezer_ for 1 hour or until yogurt is frozen.

```
Why add beans to
cookies? Black beans
contain fiber, which
helps us feel full for
longer. Don’t worry,
you won’t even taste
the black beans in the
recipe!
```
```
Kids should play for at least
one hour every day. Physical
activity helps kids keep a
healthy weight, learn in
school, build strong bones
and muscles, and sleep better
at night!

**3. Cook**
 Cooking food to the correct temperature helps kill bacteria
that can cause foodborne illness. Use a meat thermometer to
make sure your food is cooked to the correct temperature.
 Minimum safe temperatures:
 Beef, pork, veal, lamb: 145° F
 Fish and shellfish: 145° F
 Ground meats (except poultry): 160° F
 Eggs: 160° F
 Poultry: 165° F
 Leftovers and casseroles: 165° F
**4. Chill**
 Refrigerate or freeze leftovers quickly after cooking to slow
the growth of bacteria. Place warm leftovers in shallow
containers for faster cooling.
 Keep your refrigerator below 40° F and your freezer below 0°
F to keep your food safe from bacteria that cause foodborne
illnesses.
 Do not let raw meat, leftovers, or cut produce sit out for
more than two hours or more than one hour if the
temperature is above 90° F. Place foods in the refrigerator
and freezer quickly after returning from the store and after
cooking.
 Thaw frozen meats the safe way:
 Refrigerator: Place frozen meat in the refrigerator at
least a day before you plan on cooking it. Note: this
method of thawing takes the longest.
 Cold water: Place meat in a leak-proof package, then
place in cold tap water. Change the water every 30
minutes. After thawing, cook meat immediately.
 Microwave: Thaw frozen meat in the microwave, but
plan to cook it immediately after thawing.
 NEVER thaw meat on the counter or in hot water!
